 * This program starts two processes as children as illustrated below:
 *
 * wait-wrong (parent)
 * |- wait-child (child A)
 * |- wait-child <pid> (child B)
 *
 * The PID of child A is passed to child B. Child B then tries to wait for child
 * A. This should not work (i.e. "wait" should return -1) since child A is not a
 * child to child B (both are started by us).
 *
 * Depending on the implementation, this might cause the system to deadlock
 * and/or crash.
